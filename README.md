# Hybrid Proposal

** This document is an individual draft proposal. It has not been adopted by the Private Advertising Technology Community Group. **
## March 2025 Implemention and Scalability Update
The MPC algorithms for the Hybrid proposal have been implemented in this [repo](https://github.com/private-attribution/ipa).  At the March PATWG meeting we gave an update ([agenda](https://github.com/w3c/patwg/issues/29), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HCqxDh-gmGG_2uE2sdYtFfdTaBR5D8tOgEb-Lz2Brv0/edit#slide=id.g742e3e7cd_1_16)) on the scalability of this implementation and costs to run 1B and 2B row queries. 

## October 2024 Supporting Paper
The [Cookie Monster paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16719) describes the foundation for on-device DP budgeting with Individual DP. Much of this is directly relevant to the Hybrid proposal's on-device budgeting; some aspects still specific to Hybrid are ongoing work, such as formalizing IDP with late binding. 

## May 2024 Update
An [update](https://github.com/patcg/meetings/issues/181) was given on the Hybrid proposal in the May virtual PATCG. This is the [latest design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QMHkAQ4JiuJkNcyGjAkOikPKNXAzNbQKILqgvSNIAKw/edit?usp=sharing) that was shared. 

## April 2024 Presentation
